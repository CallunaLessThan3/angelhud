# LightHUD

Basically my daily HUD, a side project I have been running for years now, and still in constant evolution. I have stripped it down from any HUD elements, animations etc... I've never felt the need of, it's very minimal and tries reduce the performance impact HUDs usually have on TF2, mainly freezes but does have a pretty small fps boost compared to TF2's HUD as well!

This repository is public since I got some download requests, anyone is free to use it but I'm not really looking for any feedback on this please.
