# LightHUD

My personal HUD aimed to be very minimal and light on performance, get's rid of many elements I don't personally feel the need of and with that brings a bit more stability with less freezes and some [extra FPS](https://i.imgur.com/xOxzDt9.png).

It also experiments with a new technique, developed by me and lardox, which aims at keeping the TargetIDs medigun names as short as possible by replacing them with custom icons.
