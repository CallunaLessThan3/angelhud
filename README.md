# LightHUD

My daily HUD and side project. I stripped LightHUD down from any HUD elements, animations etc... I've never felt the need of, aims to be very minimal as well as trying to reduce the performance impact HUDs usually have on TF2, mainly freezes but does provide a fps boost compared to TF2's HUD as well!
